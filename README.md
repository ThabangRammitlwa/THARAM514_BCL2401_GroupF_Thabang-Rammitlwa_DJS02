# DJS02 Project Brief: Whole Number Divider

This project focuses on enhancing a web-based Whole Number Divider application. It's designed to help students apply their knowledge of error handling, guided by specific user stories. Before proceeding, familiarise yourself with the Gherkin syntax, a crucial tool for understanding user stories and requirements. Refer to the provided reading materials for a comprehensive guide. Below is the HTML and JavaScript code for a “Whole Number Divider”. At the moment it only meets two user stories (see below under “Resolved Stories”). Please ensure that it meets all user stories listed below:

This exercise provides user stories in [the Gherkin syntax](https://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html). Please make sure you understand the use and meaning of this syntax before continuing. Check out this resource from [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

#### Project Overview
Users may enter two integers, a dividend and a divider, into this division calculator, which then calculates the quotient. 
In order to guarantee correct input and avoid division by zero, it incorporates error handling.

### Learning experience

It is important to make sure that your calculator doesn't take anything that is not numnbers and it must throw an error in instead of adding anything that is not number.
Nothing much was entirely new about this project, some examples have been provided in previous module on Freecode camp, it was a good refresher.
Understanding the gherkin syntax makes user stories easy to understand.


#### Submission Requirements

- Updated HTML and JavaScript files.
- Submit your project to the LMS Project Tab for DJS02

This project challenges you to think critically about user input, error handling, and providing a seamless user experience. Ensure your solution is robust, user-friendly, and meets the specified requirements.
